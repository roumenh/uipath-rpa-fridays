## #06 UiPath Slack activities (project: Current weather on request)
Come and explore new Slack activities that could be useful for your bot integration. You will see demonstration of a small robot that can read messages from Slack and reply on them. As an example, the robot will retrieve current weather conditions in a given city.

## #07 Using the power of Google Vision in UiPath (5 examples)
Come and explore how RPA bot can easily detect handwritten text. Or detect certain objects in an image. Google Cloud services offer really wide possibilities when it comes to complex automation. Check source codes for integration for Google Vision technologies on 5 examples.

## #08 Super powerful automation - 5x faster execution using recursive workflows
Have your robot work in more windows at once! Your hardware is the only limit, so use it at maximum. I will show you a robot working in 5 windows at the same time, which increases the effectiveness massively. All the magic is done using recursive workflows (using Parallel activity) and one starting workflow.

## #09 Robot that plays Arkanoid
This time I will show you a fun project. Because I love to use RPA also for things that it has not been intended for. I will show you how to create a robot that plays Arkanoid. Surprisingly easily! Come and have some Friday afternoon chillout with this good old game.

## #10 UiPath Object Repository
Explore the power of Descriptors! Object repository allows you to define elements for each application and store them in a library. You can then use them in all your projects. In case the application changes and selectors change too, you only have to update the library and update it in all your projects. We will also take a look at the Modern Experience activities and some of their new features!
 
## #11 Anti-procrastination robot
Do you get often distracted from your work? Do you spend way too much time on YouTube, Facebook or any other site? Don't worry! I have a help for you! Come and learn how to build a simple robot that will help you avoid procrastination! Meanwhile, you may learn something about browser automation.

## #12 Movie picker robot
Do you have feeling like you have seen it all? Do you struggle to pick a movie to watch? Come and see how to create a robot that will help you with this! Including having your own database of movies that you already watched so robot will not suggest them. We will show you how to build this simple robot using UiPath.

## #13 Travel itinerary robot (UiPath Google Maps Activities)
It's holiday time! How do you plan your holiday trip? What about using a little help from a UiPath robot? This time I will demonstrate how to use Google Maps activities to your benefit on an example project. The robot will be given a list of places to visit and will create a nice itinerary for the trip including travel distance between places and their photos. Ready to print and go!

## #14 Robot triggered from web input
Demonstration of how to have a robot triggered by a request made through a website. You will see how to build a simple website with an input form and how to build a special website for robot to handle the data. For example request of any kind. Technologies that will be used: UiPath, HTML, PHP, and MySQL. The topic is based on the suggestion of one of our spectators.

## #15 Advanced Excel Data Manipulation (1/2)
Excel automation is still a very common use case. Come and see some of the advanced operations with Excel sheets and tables. I will show you how to: rename and duplicate sheets, automatically fill a range with data or formula, and how to sort a range. I will also show you how to create and adjust charts. All this by using UiPath, specifically doing a small hack and taking advantage of UiPath StudioX activities. In the second part of this topic, I will reveal even more!

## #16 Advanced Excel Data Manipulation (2/2)
Excel automation is still a very common use case. Come and see some of the advanced operations with Excel sheets and tables. I will show you how to: Filter the data, Run a macro, Save as PDF, export as CSV, and more! All this using UiPath Studio, specifically doing a small hack and taking advantage of UiPath StudioX activities.

## #17 YouTube reporting robot
Are you a YouTube creator and you would like to track your video views on a regular basis, for example, every day? Don't do it manually! Use the help of a software robot! I will show you how to build such a robot using the RPA tool UiPath! This showcase will include data scraping and some string manipulation, also working with Data Tables.

## #18 UiPath process started from other one. Start process from CMD. What is a background process?
There are conventional ways how to start a process in UiPath. Using UiPath Assistant, or using Orchestrator, or directly from Studio. There are also another ways how to do it and I will demonstrate them. Firstly, I will show you how you can start a process from Command Line. Later we will explore what is a background process and how we can benefit from it. I will show you also how to use Invoke Process and Run Parallel Process activities. They allow us to run a process from a process. Come to process all that new information.

## #19 Advanced automatic reply bot 
Answering emails is nowadays part of almost every job. Some people enjoy writing long emails and some colleagues are happy to get a reply fast. Amaze your boss by sending an instant meaningful answer at every email. What can possibly go wrong? :wink: Come and explore UiPath Outlook activities. Also I will show you how to work with text of the email.

## #20 The very first game made in UiPath
UiPath is a tool made to automate boring stuff, ease from repetitive tasks and so on. But what if we use its powers to create a computer game? Come to see how such game can be created and how to use user interface in Windows and your mouse to have some fun! Take it easy, come and join me!
I will use most importantly these activities: Get Position and Move Window and others for some control flow.

## #21 News in UiPath 2021.8 Release
Let me introduce you to some of the best new features and updates in upcoming UiPath release 2021.8! There are many cool changes. New activities such as Mouse Scroll, Rename File or Rename Folder. Updated and improved activities Get Attribute, For Each Mail and others. Possibility to use nested App/Browser cards. Improved Data Scraping Wizard (Table Extraction). New installer options, new Assistant features... there is quite a lot! I will cover most of the news from this UiPath update in this live webinar. Do not miss it so you are always informed about the latest tools you can use in your automation already today!

## #22 Excel data validation
So, another Excel automation won the voting at LinkedIn. So, here it is: This time I will show you how you can implement some nice data validation of data from Excel table. I will do this video based on one of our RPA Challenges. You will see how to validate if some column contains date in proper format, or if it contains exactly one from two options and also if it contains exact amount of characters.

## #23 Outlook Calendar activities
This Friday we will take a look at Outlook Calendar activities from UiPath's Marketplace. Made by Shreya Sharma to ease up work with appointments and meetings. It can access Outlook Calendar directly. Alternatively, you can use UiPath Office365 Activities, however the setup is more complicated. But also gives you more tools and options. So come check out this one!

## #24 Data validation through e-mail
Small practical UiPath RPA Automation project (use case). Emails with attachments are taken by robot from the inbox and attachments are saved. With saved attachments (Excel files), validation of the data is performed. In case of invalid data, invalid cell is highlighted red. Report is created saying in what cell is which problem.

## #25 UiPath & MongoDB
See how to integrate UiPath with MongoDB. Watch this tutorial how to read collections from MongoDB, insert new entries, delete entries and also (using C# invoke code workaround) how to update (edit) entries. Follow me in this step by step tutorial.

## #26 UiPath Unattended Robot Setup (full tutorial)
Setup of Unattended Robot is not easy, but with in tutorial I will guide you through the full setup. I will show you how to create a Robot User, how to install Unattended Robot service on desired machine and how to make it all working together. I will be also talking about licenses and their allocation. Also I will explain how Orchestrator is structured and what are Tenants and Folders good for.
